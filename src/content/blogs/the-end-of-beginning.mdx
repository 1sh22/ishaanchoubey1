As I sit here, just months away from completing my engineering journey, I can’t help but reflect on how this path has shaped me in ways I never imagined. Growing up in Bengaluru all my life, starting fresh in Mysuru was tough at first. Everything felt odd, like I didn’t belong. Engineering though, isn’t just about jobs, exams, or attendance, it’s like a little guru dishing out life lessons I didn’t sign up for. It taught me patience when things went sideways, resilience when projects flopped hard, and the art of starting over when I wanted to chuck my laptop out of the window. Every late-night study session, hunched over random PDF’s, just to make it through the semester.  But more than anything, it’s the people I stumbled into that made this chaos beautiful. The midnight hostel discussions with the boys, arguing about what’s gonna pop up in tomorrow’s test, voices loud with panic and wild guesses. 

Everyone has to experience hostel life at least once in their lives, trust me. The midnight birthday celebrations with biscuits, cakes smashed on people and terrible singing, watching movies and sleeping midway, shouting at sports matches till our throats gave up, these moments were just top tier. And oh, the folks from North Karnataka, they gifted me a vocabulary of crazy bad words I’d never dare repeat, I’m laughing just thinking about it. (Nakkann! Lmao)

Now, as the finish line creeps closer, I realize this isn’t just an end, it’s the end of a beginning. Like every story, it’s been messy, tear-jerking, and hilariously beautiful. Those sleepless nights, the gang that turned deadlines into inside jokes, the thrill of bunking classes while cursing in Kannada slang, it’s all stitched into my soul. Engineering gave me a tribe and a lens to see life: problems are just puzzles, failures are temporary, and every goodbye is a “see you later maga.” As this chapter ends, I’m not just an engineer, I’m a teary-eyed fool with a heart full of memories, ready for whatever’s next.
